      # Since tauri-action might upload artifacts itself (if configured), we need to ensure
      # we upload the NOTARIZED one.
      # tauri-action with default config uploads assets.
      # But since we didn't notarize during build, the uploaded asset by tauri-action is UN-NOTARIZED.
      # We should probably overwrite it or upload it ourselves.
      # However, tauri-action uploads at the END.
      # Wait, tauri-action runs the build AND upload in one step if tagName is set?
      # Yes.
      # So `tauri-action` will upload the un-notarized DMG *before* we get to the manual notarization step.
      # This is problematic.
      # WORKAROUND: Don't let tauri-action upload!
      # We remove `tagName` from `with`?
      # If tagName is omitted, it just builds.
      
      # Let's verify tauri-action docs behavior.
      # "If tagName is not provided, the action will simply build the app."
      
      # FIX: Remove release-related args from tauri-action so it ONLY builds.
      # Then use separate step to Upload.
