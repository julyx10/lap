# Getting Started

## Installation

### macOS (Apple Silicon)

1.  Download the latest `.dmg` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/julyx10/lap/releases).
2.  Open the disk image and drag **Lap** to your **Applications** folder.
3.  Double-click to launch.

> **Note**: If you see a "App is damaged" warning, please refer to the README or run `xattr -cr /Applications/Lap.app` in Terminal.

### Windows

Windows support is currently in development. Stay tuned!

## First Run

When you open Lap for the first time:

1.  **Grant Permissions**: Lap needs access to your folders to display photos.
2.  **Add a Library**: Point Lap to a folder containing your photos.
3.  **Let it Index**: Lap will scan your files and generate thumbnails. This happens locally and is very fast.

## AI Features

The AI features (search, face recognition) run automatically in the background. You can start searching with natural language immediately after indexing is complete.
