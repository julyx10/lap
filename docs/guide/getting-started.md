## First Run

When you open Lap for the first time:

1.  **Grant Permissions**: Lap needs access to your folders to display photos.
2.  **Add a Library**: Point Lap to a folder containing your photos.
3.  **Let it Index**: Lap will scan your files and generate thumbnails. This happens locally and is very fast.
