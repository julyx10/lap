# Introduction

**Lap** is a lightning-fast, cross-platform photo manager designed for people who value privacy and performance.

## Why Lap?

We built Lap because we were tired of choosing between **privacy** (dumb folder viewers) and **convenience** (cloud services that scan your life). Lap gives you both.

### Key Features

- **Privacy First**: Runs 100% offline. No cloud scanning.
- **Blazing Fast**: Powered by Rust and Tauri 2.
- **AI Search**: Natural language search ("red car in rain") running locally.
- **Face Recognition**: Private face clustering.
- **File System Sync**: Reflects your actual folder structure.

## Getting Started

Lap is currently available for macOS (Apple Silicon). Windows support is coming soon.
