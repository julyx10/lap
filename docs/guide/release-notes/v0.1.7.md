# Release Notes - Lap v0.1.7

Lap v0.1.7 expands cleanup and organization tools, improves browsing workflows, and makes the multi-platform release/update path more complete.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Duplicate detection workflow:** Lap now includes a dedicated duplicate-cleanup flow for scanning, grouping, and managing duplicate files.
- **Ratings support:** Files can now be rated and filtered with a proper rating system backed by persistent storage.
- **Smart tags:** Family-focused smart tags help surface common categories such as people, kids, pets, food, and travel more quickly.

### 🖼️ Browsing & Viewer Improvements
- **Smoother next-image preparation:** Image preview now preloads the next image before forward navigation to reduce visible loading.
- **Split view and viewer polish:** Image viewing gained split-view improvements and a round of navigation and status-bar refinements.

### 🔄 Release & Update Flow
- **Windows release support:** Windows MSI packaging and release publishing are now part of the release pipeline.

- **Homepage update entry:** Lap can now surface a lightweight update badge on the home screen when a new version is available.

### ✨ Info Panel & UI Polish
- **Simplified multi-select actions:** Multi-select favorite and rating controls in the info panel now match the single-file action style more closely.
- **Map labeling cleanup:** The file info map section now uses clearer wording across locales.
- **Localized date formatting:** Multi-select date summaries now follow the active locale's configured date format instead of a hard-coded pattern.
